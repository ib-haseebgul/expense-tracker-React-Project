# 💰 React Expense Tracker

This project is a simple and practical **Expense Tracker Application** built using React.  
It focuses on understanding React Hooks and applying core JavaScript concepts in a real-world mini project.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

The Expense Tracker allows users to:

- Add new expenses  
- Delete individual expenses  
- Automatically save expenses in the browser’s local storage  
- Calculate total expenses dynamically  
- Automatically focus the input field after submitting data  

This project helped strengthen my understanding of how React handles state, side effects, and re-rendering.

## 🧠 Concepts Covered

### ⚡ useState – State Management

I used useState to manage:

- The list of expenses  
- The title input field  
- The amount input field  

This helped me understand how React updates the UI whenever the state changes.

---

### 🔄 useEffect – Side Effects

I used useEffect to:

- Save expenses in localStorage  
- Automatically update stored data whenever the expense list changes  

This allowed the application to persist data even after refreshing the page.

---

### 🎯 useRef – DOM Manipulation

I used useRef to:

- Automatically focus on the title input field after adding an expense  

This improved the user experience by making the form faster and smoother to use.

---

## 🧮 JavaScript Methods Used

### ✅ Reduce Method

Used to calculate the total amount of all expenses dynamically.

### ✅ Filter Method

Used to delete a specific expense by filtering it from the expense list.

---

## 🔀 Conditional Rendering

I used a ternary operator to check whether expenses exist:

- If no expenses are added, it shows a message like "No Expense Yet".
- If expenses exist, it displays them in a list format.

## 🚀 Learning Outcome

Through this project, I gained:

- Strong understanding of React Hooks  
- Practical experience with state management  
- Better knowledge of handling forms in React  
- Improved understanding of array methods in real applications  
- Confidence in building small functional React projects
